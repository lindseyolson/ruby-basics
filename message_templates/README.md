## How to run program in your CLI:
1. Download files.
2. Navigate to the *messsage_templates* folder in your command line on your computer.
3. In the command line, run `ruby template_program.rb`.

## Design Decisions
I designed the program using object-oriented programming principles, which allows the program to be easily refactored and added onto in the future. That is why I separated most parts into their own class, this way, the code is much easier to read and understand.

## Language
I chose to use Ruby as my language of choice because of it's OOP architecture. I wanted to make use of OOP principles and I knew Ruby would be an excellent choice for this. I am also very excited about Ruby! I just started learning this language 3 weeks ago. I wanted to push myself into a project to further my knowledge and experience with Ruby.

## Process for Correctness
I do not have a process for correctness because of time commitment. I am learning how to use Minitest for Ruby currently, but did not have enough time to implement with this program. If time allowed, I would have written and implemented Minitest from the start of this project.

## What I didn't get to/What I would do with more time
1. I did not get to writing tests, along with developing code, which would be the first thing I would have wanted to add from the start.
2. I would have made sure all edge cases were taken care of (inputs being not a number or not a number listed, etc.). Now, if you are to type in a Non-number or a number not listed, the program crashes.
3. I would have refactored some code (a bit of repeating in the template_program => I made some notes).
4. I would have improved the functional code in some areas (not best practice in some functions).
5. I would like to implement the time zone that the company is located in, right now, I just have it working with the local time.
